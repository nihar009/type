        What's Good About 'Em, <br>What's Bad About 'Em</br></h1>

    <p>Despite his glum expression, the French Bulldog is comical, entertaining, and dependably amiable.</p>   
    
    <p>
    As comfortable in an apartment as he is on a farm, he is more lively than you might suspect from his chunky appearance. French Bulldog puppies are especially frisky, and ball chasing is one of their passions. Adults are more dignified and can be champion couch potatoes, but also love to clown around and go for walks in cool weather.

    <p>
    Many Frenchies are friendly with everyone, while others are politely reserved. French Bulldogs will bark to announce visitors, but are otherwise quiet dogs.
